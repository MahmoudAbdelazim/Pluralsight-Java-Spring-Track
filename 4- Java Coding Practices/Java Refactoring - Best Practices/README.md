# Java Refactoing - Best Practices
Refactoring is about improving the quality of existing code without changing the way it behaves.

Refactoring means <i>"A change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior"</i>.

Refactoring should be done continuously.

Boy Scout Rule: <i> "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it" </i>.

## Refactoring Process:
1. Verify existing behavior
2. Ensure tests are valid and passing
3. Refactor
4. Verify behavior again
