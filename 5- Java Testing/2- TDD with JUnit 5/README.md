Benefits of Test-Driven Development:
- Driven by clear goals
- Safer code
- Isolate of incorrect code
- Easily introduce new functionality
- Document the application

## Code Coverage
A measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs, measured in percentage.

### Code Coverage Tools
- JCov
- OpenClover
- EMMA
- JaCoCo (Most Popular)

IntelliJ also has its own integrated "Run with Coverage" tool.

Note: 100% code coverage doesn't mean code works perfectly, because the tests might not be good enough, and because unit testing is about testing units, while interaction between different units and classes might have bugs.
